# ADS-Zone.Identifier
This script is inelegant but straightforward and identifies downloaded files and the url from which the file was downloaded (if ADS Zone Identifier is available) in the System32 directory. Additionally, it also identifies .iso and .img files in the user's download directory. This is intended for Incident Responders, SOC Analysts, and Threat Researchers. I attempt to remove some popular OS files for those of us who do a terrible job at deleting huge .img files after they have served their purpose.
